# Security review record

The pre-3.0.0 review terminated after verifying only that YAML parsing uses a
safe schema, and a critical RCE shipped anyway ([GHSA-wq8m-fc3q-8m5x], fixed in
3.0.1). This record picks the review back up ([#121]) and states plainly what has
been examined — findings *and* the "checked, solid" list — so the unexamined
surface stays visible instead of assumed safe.

## Related: is 2.x affected by GHSA-wq8m-fc3q-8m5x?

Yes, from its first release — confirmed with the advisory's own proof-of-concept
against a clean install of every published version ([#125]). 2.0.0, 2.1.0, and
3.0.0 execute the rc-declared plugin; 1.0.x predate the `plugins` option and 3.0.1
refuses it. The backport is merged on `release/2.x` (2.1.1) and effective, but was
never published — the highest installable 2.x is the still-vulnerable 2.1.0. The
full test matrix, the advisory range correction (`>= 2.0.0, <= 3.0.0`), and the
publish recommendation are in
[`ghsa-wq8m-fc3q-8m5x-2x.md`](ghsa-wq8m-fc3q-8m5x-2x.md).

## Threat model

Flecto runs in CI with repository access and often a `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The primary
attacker is a **malicious pull request**: they control config file contents, file
names, and `.flectorc`, and CI runs Flecto over all of it. Runner-set
environment (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_API_URL`)
is **not** attacker-controlled from PR content.

## Findings (fixed)

### Regular-expression denial of service in secret detection — fixed

`src/secrets.js` ran on every changed string value under the `default` pack, so a
single crafted value in a pull request reached it. Two of its own patterns were
`O(n²)`:

- the PEM private-key pattern spanned `BEGIN…END` with a lazy `[\s\S]*?…$`,
  quadratic on a long `BEGIN`-prefixed value with no `END`;
- the URL-credentials pattern had an unbounded scheme run before the required
  `://`, quadratic on a long value that never contains `://`.

A few hundred kilobytes of a single value hung the CI job. **Fixed** by finding
the private-key markers with anchored, non-spanning regexes paired by position,
and by length-bounding the URL scheme. 1 MB now scans in well under a second;
detection of real (including unterminated) keys is unchanged. Regression tests in
`test/security.test.js`.

### YAML alias-expansion denial of service ("billion laughs") — fixed

YAML aliases resolve to shared object *references*, so a few hundred bytes of
nested aliases parse to a small DAG that `normalizeParsedValue` (in `src/parser.js`)
expands into an exponentially large tree — the expansion is deliberate so two
files with the same shape compare equal, but it was unbounded. `flecto ci` on a
tiny crafted file hung. **Fixed** with a node budget (5,000,000, far above any
real config) that fails fast with a clear error. Regression test in
`test/security.test.js`.

### Symlinked targets read files outside the repository — fixed

Recorded here previously as unhardened with "limited" impact, on the reasoning
that an attacker who controls the repo can already commit content. **That reads
the vector backwards.** The attacker does not control the file the link points
*at*, and that is the whole point of following it: on a CI runner, `~/.npmrc`,
`~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.git-credentials`, and `~/.aws/credentials` (which
is INI, and parses perfectly) are all outside the repository and all readable by
the job.

Confirmed: a pull request adding `leaked.yaml` as a symlink to a file outside
the checkout had that file parsed and its **values** emitted — in the JSON
envelope, in the job log, and in the `--format pr-comment` markdown, which
`--pr-comment-post` writes to a comment on the pull request. Opening a pull
request is the entire attack.

**Fixed** with a containment check on every resolved target, and on
`.flecto-snapshots/` before a snapshot is written. The rule is about *escape*,
not location, so the legitimate cases keep working:

| Given | Resolves to | Result |
|---|---|---|
| inside the project | inside | allowed — in-repo links still work |
| inside the project | outside | **refused** — the shape a pull request can author |
| outside the project | anywhere | allowed — `flecto compare /a.yaml /b.yaml` is operator intent |

`FLECTO_ALLOW_SYMLINK_TARGETS=1` opts out for a checkout that genuinely links
config in from a sibling directory. It refuses loudly rather than skipping the
file, for the same reason rc-declared plugins do: a target that stops being
scanned without saying so weakens a gate the operator believes is in place.

The *write* paths this paragraph left open — `--output` and `--baseline` — are
covered now; see the write-destination finding below.

### Prototype pollution in the INI parser — fixed

`parseIni` nested a section's keys under `out[section]`. A section named
`__proto__` resolved that to `Object.prototype` — which passes `isPlainObject`,
because its *own* prototype is `null` — and every key in the section was then
written onto the prototype of every object in the process. In this threat model
that is a pull request adding one `.ini` file to a repository whose CI runs
`flecto ci`.

The impact was not limited to the attacker's own file. `severityRemap[rule.id]`
is a plain-object lookup, so `[__proto__]` with `dangerous-toggle-enabled=off`
answered `'off'` for **every file in the same run** and the rule stopped firing:
a `flecto ci --fail-on error` that exited `1` on a real finding exited `0` with
the hostile file present. That is a merge-gate bypass, not only a denial of
service — though `toString=` was that too, since it replaces
`Object.prototype.toString` for the rest of the process.

**Fixed** by reading the section with `Object.hasOwn` and writing every key with
`Object.defineProperty`: a reserved name becomes an ordinary own key holding
ordinary data, which is what a config file's `[__proto__]` section is. It stays
*visible* in the diff rather than being dropped — silently discarding it would
hide a change, which is its own kind of wrong.

Two same-class sites were hardened alongside it, neither exploitable: the
masking walk in `src/renderer.js` and the copy loops in `src/encrypted.js` used
`out[key] = value`, which moves a `__proto__` subtree onto the *result's*
prototype. No value leaked — the key vanished from the output entirely — but a
change under such a key would have been invisible in masked output. Both now
rebuild with `Object.fromEntries`, as `normalizeParsedValue` already did.

Found by the fuzz harness ([#150]) on its first full-length run, at
`parse-ini` case 280 of seed 20260830. Regression tests in
`test/security.test.js`, including the end-to-end gate bypass, plus the
minimized input in `test/fixtures/fuzz/parse-ini-proto-section.json`.

### The merge gate could be turned green from `.flectorc` — fixed

`--update-baseline` rewrites the baseline file from **every finding of the
current run**, which accepts all of them: nothing is new relative to what was
just written, so the policy gate passes. The CLI help says "explicit, never
automatic", and it was neither — `updateBaseline` resolved through the ordinary
options merge, so `.flectorc` could set it, and on an untrusted pull request
`.flectorc` is a file the attacker wrote.

Confirmed end to end: a repository where `flecto ci --fail-on error` exits `1` on
a real finding exits `0` once a pull request adds four lines of `.flectorc`. A
profile reaches it too. Note what this overrides — the `--fail-on` in that
command is on the **command line**, chosen by the workflow author, and rc-declared
`updateBaseline` defeats it anyway. That is the property that separates this from
an rc file merely configuring `failOn`, which is the operator delegating the gate
to the repository and is working as designed.

**Fixed** by refusing `updateBaseline` from `.flectorc` entirely — no opt-out
environment variable, because unlike a plugin path or a write destination there
is no legitimate reason to declare an action in a settings file. It refuses
loudly rather than ignoring the key, so a repository that meant it finds out.
`--update-baseline` on the command line is unchanged. Regression tests in
`test/security.test.js`, including the profile route and the still-working CLI
path.

### Write destinations could be redirected out of the repository — fixed

The previous record left this open: "`--output` (`flecto report`) and `--baseline`
are *write* paths, and a symlinked destination redirects the write rather than a
read." Attacked, and it is worse than the symlink half alone — **both options can
be declared in `.flectorc`**, so the destination need not involve a link at all.

Three shapes confirmed against a real repository, each writing outside the
checkout with exit code `0`:

| Given in `.flectorc` | Result |
|---|---|
| `"output": "../home/.bashrc"` | the HTML report overwrote a file outside the project |
| `"output": "link.html"` (a symlink out) | the write followed the link |
| `"baseline": "../home/x.json"` + `updateBaseline` | a JSON file written outside the project |

Neither file is inert content. The report embeds config values and file names,
and a baseline embeds rule ids, file paths, and messages — all of which the pull
request authored. On a runner, the reachable destinations include shell profiles,
workflow files, and SSH config.

**Fixed** with a containment rule that follows the provenance, in
`assertWriteDestinationContained`:

- **Declared in `.flectorc`** — must resolve inside the project.
  `FLECTO_ALLOW_RC_WRITES=1` opts out, for a repository that genuinely configures
  a destination elsewhere.
- **Any source** — must not leave the project through a symlink, checked on the
  destination itself and on the directory it lands in.
  `FLECTO_ALLOW_SYMLINK_TARGETS=1` opts out of this half, as it does for reads.

The link check resolves the chain by hand rather than asking whether the
destination exists. `existsSync` follows links, so a link whose target is *not
there yet* reports as absent and would skip the check — and that is the sharper
half of the attack, not the weaker one: a link to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` or an
unused git hook has Flecto **create** the file rather than overwrite one.

A destination named on the **command line** is operator intent and is untouched,
the same distinction the read rule already draws: `flecto report --output
/tmp/drift.html` still works.

### The GitLab token followed redirects — fixed

`fetch` removes `Authorization` when a redirect crosses origins, and it removes
**only that header**. GitLab authenticates with `PRIVATE-TOKEN`, which is not
covered: verified against a local server, a `302` from the API host forwarded
`PRIVATE-TOKEN: glpat-…` to the redirect target in full. GitHub and Bitbucket use
`Authorization` and are stripped by the platform.

The API host comes from runner environment (`CI_API_V4_URL`), not from pull
request content, so this is not reachable from the primary threat model — it needs
a hostile or compromised API host, or a self-hosted instance redirecting
somewhere unexpected. It is still a credential leaving for a host nobody chose,
and the fix costs nothing: requests are issued with `redirect: 'manual'` and a
3xx is refused with a message naming the origin it pointed at. These endpoints do
not legitimately redirect, and one that does is worth seeing rather than
following.

### Bitbucket path segments were interpolated unencoded — hardened

`BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE` and `BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG` went into the request path raw,
while GitLab's project id was already encoded. Not exploitable — both come from
runner environment, and a path segment cannot move the request to another host —
but a value carrying `/`, `?`, or `#` restructures the URL rather than naming a
repository. Both are `encodeURIComponent`d now, matching GitLab.

## Checked — no change needed

- **Command execution (`--command`, `src/alerter.js`).** Env var *names* are
  fixed (`FLECTO_*`); attacker config content lands only as the *value* of
  `FLECTO_CHANGES`, passed via the child's environment, never interpolated into
  the shell. The command string itself is operator intent, and `--command` exists
  only in `watch`, not in the `ci` path a PR triggers. No injection from config
  content.
- **Token handling (`src/pr-comment.js`).** The token is read from
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`, sent only as a `Bearer` header to `GITHUB_API_URL` (default
  `api.github.com`), and stripped from every error string surfaced to the user.
  `apiUrl`, `repo`, and `prNumber` come from runner env, not PR files, so PR
  content cannot redirect the token or induce SSRF. Posting is opt-in and needs a
  complete PR context.
- **Prototype pollution in JSON, YAML, TOML, and dotenv.** A `__proto__` /
  `constructor.prototype` key becomes an ordinary own property (the parser's
  `isPlainObject` checks the prototype and normalization rebuilds via
  `Object.fromEntries`); it does not reach `Object.prototype`. The differ and
  pack loading were exercised with such keys and stayed clean, and the fuzz
  targets now exercise all of it continuously. **INI was not covered by this
  claim and was vulnerable** — see the finding above. The lesson is the narrow
  one: this list is per code path, and "the parser" is five of them.
- **`policies add` package safety.** Resolves the target with `require.resolve`
  (path only, never evaluated) and reads the pack JSON off disk; it never
  `import()`s the package, so it runs no package code. (`npm install`-time
  `postinstall` is outside Flecto's control and is an npm concern.) The pack id
  becomes a filename under `policies/`, and it is constrained to a single plain
  segment before it gets there: `../../evil`, `flecto-pack-../../evil`, and their
  percent-encoded forms are all refused by `normalizePackPackageName`, so the
  write cannot leave the directory.
- **Deeply nested YAML.** js-yaml's default schema caps nesting depth (~100), so
  a deep-nesting document is rejected at parse rather than overflowing the stack.
- **GitLab and Bitbucket token handling** ([#147], the surface [#138] added). Tokens
  are read from environment only, sent as a single auth header to the API URL from
  runner environment, and stripped from every error string by the same `redact`
  the GitHub path uses — including the failure and timeout paths. Neither token
  is honored from `.flectorc` or from any file the repository can contain.
  Detection is by CI variables, and posting still requires `--pr-comment-post`
  plus a complete merge request context. Two things did change: see the redirect
  finding and the segment-encoding note above.
- **An API URL over plain `http`.** `CI_API_V4_URL` / `GITHUB_API_URL` /
  `BITBUCKET_API_URL` are runner environment, so a plaintext API URL is the
  operator describing their own network, not an attacker redirecting anything.
  Not refused, deliberately — a self-hosted instance on an internal `http` host is
  a real deployment, and refusing it would break a legitimate setup to prevent a
  configuration the operator already controls.
- **Enormous files.** Measured rather than reasoned about: 9.3 MB of YAML parses,
  diffs, and gates in 1.6 s; 44 MB in 9.0 s. Cost is linear, with no quadratic
  or exponential shape to trip, and the practical ceiling is the git host's own
  file-size limit. A file large enough to exhaust the heap aborts the process
  non-zero, which fails the build closed rather than passing it.

## Not yet closed

- **Attacker-supplied regexes in custom packs.** A `.flectorc`-selected local
  pack can carry a catastrophic `match.path` / `afterMatches`. Node has no regex
  timeout, so a full fix means a timeout-capable engine (e.g. `re2`) — a
  dependency decision left to the maintainer. Documented as a known limitation in
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## Fuzzing the same boundary

Everything above is manual review, and manual review finds what someone thought
to look for. `npm run fuzz` ([#150], [`test/fuzz/README.md`](../test/fuzz/README.md))
keeps looking at the same boundary after the reviewer has moved on: structure-aware
targets over `parseContent` per format, `diffTrees`, `expandChangeSubtrees`, the
regexes in `secrets.js` and `encrypted.js`, and pack loading and evaluation.

The invariant is the one this record has been assuming: **it either succeeds or
throws a clean `Error` — never hangs, never exhausts memory, never returns a
prototype-polluted object** — with a per-case time budget, because a target that
takes seconds is a denial of service on a CI runner whether or not it returns.

Two scoping notes, so the target list is read for what it is:

- **Pack-supplied regexes are fuzzed with bounded quantifiers.** A pack author
  can already hang the process, which is the known limitation in
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md); generating that class would re-report it every
  night rather than find anything. What is fuzzed is everything around it —
  compilation, flags, and evaluation.
- **A cyclic tree reaching `diffTrees` throws rather than returning.** That
  satisfies the contract, and the parser's circular sentinel means a cycle cannot
  arrive from a parsed file in the first place.

Fuzzing runs nightly, not on pull requests, and files nothing automatically:
findings on this boundary may be exploitable rather than merely a hang, and those
are reported privately per [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## Knowing what has been exercised

"Checked — no change needed" above is a claim about what a reader looked at.
Coverage is the mechanical half of the same question: which branches of these
modules has **no test ever executed**?

```sh
npm run coverage
```

That runs the suite under `node --test --experimental-test-coverage` and prints a
focused report — the modules where an untested branch is a security question
rather than a style one, worst branch coverage first, with the count of branches
that never ran:

```
Security-relevant modules (worst branch coverage first)
  file                         lines  branch   funcs  missed
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  src/config.js                97.4%   84.3%  100.0%      19
  src/policy.js                95.5%   88.4%  100.0%      44
  ...
```

It runs in CI on every pull request and prints in the job log, so it needs no
artifact download to read. **No threshold gates it** ([#149]): a number chosen
before anyone has read the report is arbitrary, and the usual outcome is tests
written to satisfy the gate rather than to find defects. The list is a place to
start a review, and a way to know when one is finished — not a score.

The focused list, and the reason each module is on it, lives at the top of
[`scripts/coverage-report.js`](../scripts/coverage-report.js). It is meant to be
argued with and edited rather than grown until it is the whole repository again.

Coverage says a branch ran, not that it ran with the input an attacker would
choose. It narrows where to look; it does not replace looking.
